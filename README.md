# Bussines Context
> We received the data from a company called ‚ÄúACME Investments‚Äù and we have to process it into ORCA.
> The following steps are required to complete this exercise:

# Assignment
The following steps are required to complete this exercise:
1. Create a process to read, validate, and clean the data.
2. Create the loan schedules.
3. Transform and structure the data to our own format.
4. Query our database to get insights.

# Solution
## Architecture
![image](https://github.com/camilocbarrera/data-challenge/assets/85809276/b3cc92f7-d026-4a2a-856a-56565f1fea76)
To address this scenario, my approach aims to leverage industry-leading architectural best practices for the entire data extraction, loading, and transformation workflow, all while utilizing a Modern Data Stack.

A streamlined architecture is suggested, comprising Snowflake, AWS Lambda (Python), Fivetran, and PowerBI.

Why opt for Snowflake? From my experience, it stands out as the most efficient, easy-to-implement solution that enables us to direct our focus on the crucial aspect‚Äîdata analysis.
> Snowflake serves as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) analytics data warehouse. Unlike traditional data warehouses that depend on existing databases or "big data" platforms such as Hadoop, Snowflake operates on a unique, cloud-native SQL database engine.

## Project Structure
The project structure is as follows:

- [airflow](airflow) In this folder, you will find the Dags and Tasks that orchestrate the components of the proposed architecture.

- [custom_elt](custom_elt) This folder contains custom code for data extraction. In the current use case, you will be able to find the extraction and loading process from SFTP to AWS S3.

- [dbt_analytics](dbt_analytics) The transformation part was carried out using DBT, one of the most widely-used frameworks for data transformation.


## Data Engineering
In this scenario, we leveraged AWS Lambda Functions written in Python to execute a batch processing workflow. The process involved utilizing Docker to create a containerized environment, and the resulting image was uploaded to the AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) service. As a key component of the architecture, Fivetran was incorporated to streamline the data loading process, enhancing the efficiency of data ingestion.
Review the code of this function [here](custom_elt%2Flambda_functions%2Facme-investments). 

To illustrate the architecture, the AWS Lambda Function orchestrated the batch process, interacting with the Docker image stored in the AWS ECR. The Lambda Function executed Python code to perform the desired data transformations and operations. The containerized environment ensured consistency and isolation throughout the process.

Furthermore, Fivetran played a significant role in simplifying the data loading workflow. By utilizing Fivetran, the focus shifted from traditional ETL tasks to more intricate data modeling endeavors. Fivetran's data source agnosticism, automated data pipelines, real-time synchronization, data transformation capabilities, and robust monitoring and alerting features contributed to a seamless integration process.

By utilizing Fivetran, the complexities of data integration were mitigated, allowing for the optimization of time and resources. Data accuracy and timeliness were ensured, and the data engineers were able to establish efficient and reliable data pipelines. Additional insights about Fivetran's capabilities can be found at: [https://www.fivetran.com/data-movement/saas-replication](https://www.fivetran.com/data-movement/saas-replication)

## Data Modeling with DBT

The process of data modeling will be accomplished using [DBT](https://www.getdbt.com/product/what-is-dbt/) (Data Build Tool), a versatile open-source command line tool designed to enhance the effectiveness of data transformation within a data warehouse. Originating at RJMetrics in 2016, DBT emerged as a solution to introduce fundamental transformation capabilities to the Stitch platform.

The proposed approach for modeling entails adopting a decoupled distribution strategy. This strategic choice fosters scalability in all dimensions, promoting loose coupling and strong cohesion among the various models. The envisioned methodology is illustrated below:
![Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85809276/231127215-d8db4c69-749e-4da0-a235-10c00068d203.png)

In each stage of this process, models are meticulously constructed along with their corresponding tests, snapshots, and metrics. Each layer is segregated, ensuring a structured and organized approach to modeling. For a deeper understanding, refer to the directory labeled "models/marts."

### DBT Architectural Structure

The architecture, as depicted in the initial image, is notably modular. This modularity facilitates component reusability, upholding a balance between low cohesion and high coupling. This design philosophy ensures flexibility and maintainability throughout the modeling process.

### DAG Lineage

The data progression, illustrated in the following stages, traverses from data sources through Staging, intermediate report, and culminates in Report layer. The semantic layer will supported by Power BI.

### 2. Create the loan schedules.
Despite the complexity of this section due to its recursive nature, the development was carried out using SQL ü•∑ through a recursive CTE (Common Table Expression) in Snowflake. This allows for the calculation of values without the need for a heuristic process. As demonstrated in the following query:

```snowflake

     SELECT
          customer_id                                                                                       AS customer_id

### 3. Transform and structure the data to our own format.


> Export the data into 4 datasets with ORCA‚Äôs structure that will be stored in our database.

The 4 datasets can be accessed, exported, and consumed from various applications through tables, as demonstrated below.

The logic behind the modeling was executed in SQL and constructed using DBT.

```snowflake
-- actualpayments
SELECT
     id
   , loanid
   , paymentdate
   , principalpaid
   , interestpaid
FROM analytics.dev_reporting.actualpayments;

-- borrowers
SELECT
     id
   , borrowerid
   , customersince
   , income
   , state
FROM analytics.dev_reporting.borrowers;

-- expectedpayments
SELECT
     id
   , loanid
   , installmentnumber
   , expectedprincipal
   , expectedinterest
FROM analytics.dev_reporting.expectedpayments;
-- loans
SELECT
     id
   , loanid
   , borrowerid
   , disbursementdate
   , disbursementamount
   , originationfee
   , apr
   , interestrate
   , term
   , score
